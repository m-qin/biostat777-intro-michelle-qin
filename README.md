# Michelle Qin's Personal Website
As part of the BSPH 140.777 course (taken fall 2023), I have created this personal website (the homepage is `index.qmd`) using Quarto and GitHub pages. My website introduces me (I am a first-year biostatistics PhD student at Johns Hopkins University) and shares a self-contained project analyzing voter turnout in the 2022 general election in Baltimore City.
