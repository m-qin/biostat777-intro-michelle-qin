# Michelle Qin's Personal Website
As part of the BSPH 140.777 course (taken fall 2023), I created this personal website using Quarto and GitHub pages. My website introduces me and shares a self-contained project analyzing voter turnout in the 2022 general election in Baltimore City. The homepage is `index.qmd`.
