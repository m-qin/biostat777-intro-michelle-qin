    "text": "In this project, I explore voter turnout in the 2022 general election across Baltimore City’s 28 wards. (A ward is a geographic unit used by city government. A ward is larger than a precinct and smaller than a district.) My intended audience is the general public.\nThis project was inspired by a class called Baltimore Community Data Science, taught by Dr. Ava Hoffman, Dr. Michael Rosenblum, and Dr. Carrie Wright, in partnership with League of Women Voters-Baltimore City and other community-based organizations (Women Voters-Baltimore City 2023). My project builds on past work by Michael Dunphy, Carrie Wright, and others, who analyzed the 2020 general election in Baltimore City (Dunphy 2022; Wright 2022). I would also like to thank my classmates Lauren Klein and Ugochi Ejiobu and Dr. Michael Rosenblum, who worked and learned alongside me on voting in Baltimore City.\n\n\nA general election is the final election (as opposed to a primary election) for a government office and occurs on Election Day on the first Tuesday of November every year. In 2022, Election Day was November 8.\n\n\n\n\n\nBaltimore City Wards and Precincts in 2012, obtained from the Board of Elections website (Elections 2012). Boundaries may have shifted since then.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor this project, I downloaded, parsed, and analyzed Baltimore City’s official report of election results by voting precinct for the 2022 general election (also called the 2022 “gubernatorial” election because the highest office being elected was the governor of Maryland) (Elections, n.d.).\nI focused on voter turnout, which is only a small subset of all the information contained in the original report. (The majority of the report covers the outcomes, i.e., number and percentage of votes received by all the candidates, of all the national, state, and local elections that Marylanders voted on on November 8, 2022.) For the dataset that I ultimately generated, I provide the following data dictionary:\n\nPrecinct (text, 296 unique values): Voting precinct, in the form of three digits indicating the ward, followed by a hyphen, followed by three digits indicating the precinct within that ward. For example, “028-015” is the 15th precinct in the 28th ward. Voting-eligible citizens are assigned to a precinct, where they may vote at a polling place on Election Day, based on where they live.\nVariable (text, 3 unique values): Either the number of registered voters in a given precinct, or the number of ballots collected in a given precinct on Election Day, or the number of blank ballots collected in a given precinct on Election Day. A voter may turn in a blank ballot for a variety of reasons, such as protest, disinterest, or uncertainty, so the city counts the number of such ballots.\nCount (number): The number quantifying the Variable column."

    "text": "Analyze and visualize the data\nRecognizing that a precinct is a very small geographical unit, containing only one polling place, I aggregate the 296 precincts into the 28 wards of Baltimore City.\nThen, I calculate the voter turnout in two ways: (1) number of ballots collected divided by number of registered voters or (2) number of non-blank ballots collected divided by number of registered voters. In the plots below, the red line is the city-wide average voter turnout (which is 37.1% when blank ballots are included and 35.5% when blank ballots are not included), calculated in the same two ways.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nA voter may turn in a blank ballot for a variety of reasons, including protest of the candidates or the government, disinterest, or uncertainty/lack of confidence. Submitting a blank ballot takes a little more effort than abstaining (i.e., not voting), even though it does not change the outcome of an election. This is why election boards generally count the number of blank ballots.\n\n\n\n\n\nCode to analyze and visualize the data\n# location on user's computer\ndir &lt;- \"\"\n\n# read data\nturnout_2022_table &lt;- read_csv(paste0(dir, \"data/baltimore_city_2022_general_election_turnout_results.csv\"))\n\n# reshape table and calculate more variables\nturnout_2022_table &lt;- turnout_2022_table %&gt;%\n  mutate(Ward = substr(Precinct, start = 1, stop = 3)) %&gt;%\n  pivot_wider(names_from = Variable,\n              values_from = Count) %&gt;%\n  rename(Registered = `REGISTERED VOTERS -

The Maryland Department of Legislative Services produced a helpful graphic (shown below) of voter turnout across Maryland’s counties in not only the 2022 general election but also 2018 and 2020 (Maryland Department of Legislative Services 2023).\n\nFrom this graphic, which is reassuringly consistent with the 37.1% I calculated for Baltimore City’s all-ballots voter turnout in 2022, we see that Baltimore City’s turnout is significantly lower than other counties in 2022, as well as in 2018 and 2020.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nBaltimore City is classified as a county on its own and should be distinguished from a different county called Baltimore County.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nThe 2022 general election report I used for this data analysis did not mention absentee or mail-in ballots, so I am assuming that such ballots were included in the precinct numbers. However, this is an assumption, and I am also assuming the same of the Maryland Department of Legislative Services’s graphic of 2018 and 2020 voter turnout (shown above)."

I received my bachelor’s degree in statistics along with a minor in global health & health policy from Harvard. I am now living in Baltimore, Maryland, where I am studying biostatistics as PhD student at Johns Hopkins.\nDuring my undergraduate years, I was inspired to pursue a career in public health after working with Dr. Cécile Viboud and a cross-institutional team of epidemiologists and other domain area experts to project COVID-19 cases, deaths, and hospitalizations in the United States, with the goal of advising decision-makers. Then, I had the wonderful opportunity to work with Dr. Francesca Dominici’s group to estimate the causal effects of three air pollutants on elderly Americans’ Alzheimer’s-related hospitalization rates.\nOver the course of my graduate education, I am excited to gain statistical expertise while identifying areas where I can have a positive, collaborative, public health impact. I am particularly interested in using statistics to promote health equity.\nIn my free time, I enjoy running, reading, and getting to know my new city."
